# Diwanee-boiler
SCSS only boilerplate for starting new projects

## Installation
- Download the project
- cd into project folder
- run 'npm install'
- run 'bower install'
- run 'gulp' to compile SCSS to CSS


## KNOWN ISSUES
- On first start of gulp server, the server starts before the 'app' folder is generated
- Slick Carousel css is missing on first load, to fix this, start gulp and change any .scss file
